To me, I definitely think that the academic reputation of a university is the most important thing a student should consider. For one thing, with higher academic reputation, the university will have better facilities and faculties. For example, these university will have better labs and more famous professors. On top of that, attending a university with higher reputation, students will become more successful in terms of academic and have a brighter future. So, to sum up, if I have to choose, I will definitely opt for considering a school with better academic reputation.
