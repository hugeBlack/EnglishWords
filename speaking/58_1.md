Question:
Imagine you are looking for a new place to live near your university.You have two choices. The first place is a house, which you would share with several other students. The second place is a small apartment, which you would not have to share with others.Which would you choose? Explain why.

Answer:
To me, I definite think that it's better to live in a small apartment. For one thing, there is no other people in the arpartment, so I can stay concentrated on my own study, which is more efficient comparing to stying in an house with other students. On top of that, living in a apartment brings me privacy which a house cannot bring. For example, living in a personal apartment, I won't worry about other people peeking at my phone when I'm chatting with my friends. So, to sum up, if I had to choose, I would definitly opt for renting a apartment.

I definitely think it's better to live in a small apartment. First of all, there's no one else in the apartment, so I can focus on my studies without distractions, which is more efficient than living in a house with other students. Additionally, living in an apartment gives me the privacy that a shared house can't offer. For example, iI won't worry about other people peeking at my phone. So, if I had to choose, I would definitely opt for renting an apartment.
