Some people like to specifically plan how they will spend their free time. Others prefer to keep their free time open and not schedule activities in advance.
Which do you prefer and why?

To me, I definitely think that it's better to not to schedule my free time ahead of time. For one thing, I'm always in a busy schedule and cannot predict when my free time is avaliable. Planning ahead will only ruin my routine. On top of that, I can follow my heart and do whatever I want during a not planned free time. For example, I can choose whether to stay with my family, or even go out for hiking. So, to sum up, if I had to choose, I would definitely opt for keeping my free time open.
