Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
It is important for children to learn to draw or paint.
Use details and examples to explain your opinion.

To me, I definitely think that it's not necessary for children to learn drawing or painting. For one thing, not all children are capable to draw. I remember when I was a child and was learning to paint, I just can't draw any descent painting even after a year of training. On top of that, there are many other ways to cultivate children's artistic ability, like signing for example. So to sum up, I definitely think that it is not important for children to learn how to draw or paint.
