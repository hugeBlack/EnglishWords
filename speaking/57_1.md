Explain why by using details and examples to support your opinion.

To me, I definitely think that it is better to think carefully before making a decision. For one thing, after thinking for an amount of time, we can weigh the pros and cons of an decision and probably make a right decison. On top of that, is a certain decision is of great importance, I may need to consult my parents, friends and even professionals before making that decision to make sure I won't regret afterwards. So, to sum up, it I had to choose, I would definitely opt for making a careful decision instead of jumping to a conclusion.
